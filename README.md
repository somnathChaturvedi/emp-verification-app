# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Employment Verification Web Application

## Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Open the application in VS code or similar editor. (node js must be installed in your system)
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the React development server (usually on `http://localhost:3000`).

## Backend (ASP.NET Core)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Run the application in Visual Studio 2022 (.NET 8.0) (usually on `http://localhost:5000`).

## Testing the Application

1. Open the React app in your browser.
2. Enter Employee ID, Company Name, and Verification Code, then click "Verify".
3. The verification result (Verified/Not Verified) will be displayed based on the response from the backend API.

## Assumptions

- The backend uses an in-memory data structure to store employees. It can be easily replaced with a database like SQLite for persistence.
